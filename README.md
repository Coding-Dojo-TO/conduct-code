# Conduct Code 

The Toronto Coding Dojo is a non-profit community with an objective to gather people who want to learn about programming language to improve their knowledge using the best practices. Everyone are welcome to join us, and it doesnâ€™t matter if you are a self starter, curious or a senior, just come and bring your friends to the Toronto Coding Dojo.

## Every member of Toronto Coding Dojo should be:

### Respectful
Every community member, independent of the sexual orientation, nation, race color, religion, age, must be respected. Any insult or acts of these genres will not be tolerated by the community.

### Friendly
We all were a beginner one day. The Toronto Coding Dojo strives to make members no only to contribute, but also feel comfortable asking questions and learning along the way. If someone says something wrong or accidentally offensive, be patient and respond politely.

### Courteous
Community members should be considerate with each other. Toronto Coding Dojo actions are carried out by its members, who invest time and effort in doing something useful for the community. Be kind in approaching the efforts of others.

### Helpfulness
Community members must be helpful and open to collaboration. We hope Toronto Coding Dojo will be an environment where members feel comfortable sharing and receiving new ideas, giving and receiving feedback, and most of all, making a difference in our community.
